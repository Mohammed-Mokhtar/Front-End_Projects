## Overview

Omnifood creates custom meal plans tailored to personal tastes and nutritional needs, delivering healthy meals to users every single day. The service has delivered over 250,000 meals in the last year and works with various dietary requirements including Vegan, Keto, and Gluten-free.

## Key Features

* **365-Day Coverage**: Subscriptions cover every day of the year, including major holidays.
* **Local and Organic**: Meals are prepared by professional chefs using only local, fresh, and organic ingredients.
* **Sustainability**: Partners use reusable containers for all meal deliveries to ensure zero waste.
* **Flexibility**: Users can pause their subscription at any time, such as during vacations, and receive refunds for unused days.
* **AI Personalization**: An AI algorithm selects from over 5,000 recipes based on user preferences.

## How it Works

The service operates in three simple steps:

1. **Preferences**: Users tell the AI what they like and dislike to create a 100% personalized weekly plan.
2. **Approval**: Once per week, users approve the generated plan, with the option to swap meals or ingredients.
3. **Delivery**: Chefs cook the meals daily, and they are delivered at a time and location convenient for the user.
